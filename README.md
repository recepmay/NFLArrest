Project has been completed in 4 and a half hours in total.

Editing README.md file and uploading to GitHub is not included in given time above.

I have tried to complete the projects step by step as given in the instructions.

However I couldn't finish some of the tasks which is listed at the end of the milestones.

I have used Angular Material for UI part.

All navigation movements can be done by the menu placed on the left corner.

External data services for top crimes, players for crimes and teams for crimes has been added.

Relevant compenents for each services has been added.

Fetched data has been listed using angular material table.

Filtering, sorting and pagination functionalities has been implemented through table component.

Additional component for timeline feature has been added for crime.

In timeline component selection of the year can be done if only crime is selected.

Chart.js has been used for visualization.

After selecting year, bar chart is drawn for relevant data.

*What Can Be Done*

Since I had very limited time I had some things in mind that I couldn't implement. Here they are:

- I was planning to add error handling mechanism for each component and services.

- Alerts could be added to inform user about the process in case of failure or success.

- I could implement unit tests in order to be sure that each component is rendered as desired. I would definetely do that since test cases are the backbones of an application.

- I could have used state management tools like ngrx in order to create a data store and handle all the data from only one place. That would prevent sending requests to the server each time I call a component which is not efficient at the moment. 

- I could use pipes and filters manipulate data in order to make data manipulation better. I used filters but there are some other cases it can be used which I skipped.

- Chart is not working properly at the moment. After selecting a few years in a row, chart is acting abnormally. I couldn't have more time to investigate the reason so I would test and find other relevant bugs if I had more time.

- In chart view I could use month names instead of only the number of the month if I had time to do it in order to have a meaningful information for the users.
